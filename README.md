# Three-Dimensional-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, but played on three levels. You can win by connecting three of your positions in a row on any single level. But you can also score by having three connected across levels. The game is more fun because it is easier to win, so there is often a winner and every game played doesn't end in a draw. Also, the game is open source. The onboard computer has the Arduino UNO bootloader and there is an FTDI port to allow easy uploading of sketches. You can make the game your own or re-purpose the hardware for another project.
